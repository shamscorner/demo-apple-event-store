# Apple Store Events
A demo SvelteKit project using Tailwind CSS. In this project we explore how to create the apple's app store events list.

## Developing

Once you've installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev
or,
pnpm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
or,
pnpm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
or,
pnpm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
